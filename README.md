# Simple-MVP-Example

This is a very simple android application to understand the Model View Presenter (MVP) Architecture.

The app uses retrofit to call https://swapi.co and display the Star Wars Films in a RecyclerView. Clicking on a film starts a new Activity which make another API call and display more info about the movie.

I made this app by following <a href="https://blacklenspub.com/what-the-hell-is-mvp-and-what-does-it-have-to-do-with-android-99254f8affac" target="_blank">this</a> medium post by <a href = "https://github.com/travisp101" target = "_blank" >Travis</a>.
